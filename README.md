## Section 0: Introduction

We live in a world where Big Companies and Govenernments are tracking our every click, movement and any other action done in our digital lives and that is kinda scary to think about, what can we do about this 21st century problem and take back our sensitive private data? We can reduce how much sensitive data our phones automatically send to 3rd parties by elemitating the spyware and take back our right to user privacy! 

## Section 1: Prerequisites
- An Android smartphone that you own (Sorry iPhone users you are on your own)
- A Windows 10, Linux or MacOS computer to run the program
- You will need to have a little bit of technical knowledge if you plan to follow this guide on Linux or MacOS
- It is best to Factory reset your phone with all your Data Backed up first

## Section 2: Universal Android Debloater

If you are planning on Degoogling you Android Phone there is a likely chance that your default launcher might break when removing these system applications so just in case install a different launcher before proceeding. I use [Nova Launcher](https://apkpure.com/nova-launcher/com.teslacoilsw.launcher) but feel free to browse for a different option.

If there is a custom Android rom avalible for your smartphone by all means please install it but for the rest of us we don't have that option:( Instead we are going to use a program that will help us disable the spyware that plagues our daily lives called Universal Android Debloater! [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z52_v0RFKp8) tutorial by Chavez DIY is very helpful!

To view all of your currently installed apps install the [App Inspector](https://apkpure.com/app-inspector/com.ubqsoft.sec01) to show you what your system has, Universal Android debloater should indicate which system apps are safe to remove and if something goes wrong you can always undo the change! NOTE: unless you have root access you cannot truely uninstall that application it just disables it. An idea of what to uninstall is any apps such as Facebook or Samsung health where you cannot remove them through normal means, you should also try to disable all the Google Apps that come preinstalled as well as Google Play Services(GPS) and Google Services Framework(GSF) so that you don't have Google by your shoulder watching everything you do.
