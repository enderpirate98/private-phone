## Section 0: Introduction

We live in a world where Big Companies and Govenernments are tracking our every click, movement and any other action done in our digital lives and that is kinda scary to think about, what can we do about this 21st century problem and take back our sensitive private data? We can reduce how much sensitive data our phones automatically send to 3rd parties by elemitating the spyware and take back our right to user privacy! 

## Section 1: Prerequisites
- An Android smartphone that you own (Sorry iPhone users you are on your own)
- A Windows 10, Linux or MacOS computer to run the program
- You will need to have a little bit of technical knowledge if you plan to follow this guide on Linux or MacOS
- It is best to Factory reset your phone with all your Data Backed up first

## Section 2: Universal Android Debloater

If you are planning on Degoogling you Android Phone there is a likely chance that your default launcher might break when removing these system applications so just in case install a different launcher before proceeding. I use [Nova Launcher](https://apkpure.com/nova-launcher/com.teslacoilsw.launcher) but feel free to browse for a different option.

If there is a custom Android rom avalible for your smartphone by all means please install it but for the rest of us we don't have that option:( Instead we are going to use a program that will help us disable the spyware that plagues our daily lives called Universal Android Debloater! [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z52_v0RFKp8) tutorial by Chavez DIY is very helpful!

To view all of your currently installed apps install the [App Inspector](https://apkpure.com/app-inspector/com.ubqsoft.sec01) to show you what your system has, Universal Android debloater should indicate which system apps are safe to remove and if something goes wrong you can always undo the change! 

NOTE: unless you have root access you cannot truely uninstall that application it just disables it. 

An idea of what to uninstall is any apps such as Facebook or Samsung health where you cannot remove them through normal means, you should also try to disable all the Google Apps that come preinstalled as well as Google Play Services(GPS) and Google Services Framework(GSF) so that you don't have Google by your shoulder watching everything you do.

The Android Debloater should tell you what is safe to disable and what is not so generally follow it's advice

## Section 3: Private App Alternatives

First we need a Central App store that gives us easy Access to install the apps we need in our daily lives, in order to do that we need to install F-droid and Aurora Store, Download F-droid from https://f-droid.org and install it, we can then install Aurora from F-droid and that gives us access to all the apps you could dream of.

App Stores: Aurora Store which is a privacy respecting frontend for Google Play, F-droid which is an app store that gives you access to FOSS apps made by the community for the community

Browser: Vivaldi, Firefox, Duckduckgo or Brave all available from Aurora

Email Client: K-9 Mail on F-droid or Prontonmail(Paid but still good) on Aurora

YouTube Client: [Grayjay](https://grayjay.app) or Newpipe available on F-droid

Office Suite: OnlyOffice avalible on Aurora

Maps: Organic maps on F-droid or Magic Earth on Aurora

Calling and texting: Signal Private Messager on Aurora or Simple Dialer&Simple SMS Messager both on F-droid

Note Taking: Standard Notes or Simple Notes Pro both on F-droid

Calculator: [Calculator](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.xlythe.calculator.material/) on F-droid

Password Manager: Bitwarden on Aurora

Contact Manager: Contact Diary or Simple Contacts Pro both on F-droid

Calendar: Etar or Simple Calendar Pro both on F-droid

Camera: Open Camera or Simple Camera both on F-droid

Gallery: Fossify Gallery on F-droid or [Simple Gallery](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Gallery/releases)

Keyboard: AnySoftKeyboard on F-droid

System Launcher: Nova Launcher on Aurora or Lawnchair Launcher on F-droid

Weather: Your Local Weather on F-droid

Media Player: Vlc on F-droid

Music/Audio Player: Music or Metro both on F-droid

Podcast: Antenna Pod on F-droid

If certain apps require Google Play Services or Google Services Framework there is a FOSS app that will try to replace these so that some apps still work but without the spyware, [microG](https://microg.org/download.html) will hopefully do that well enough (Disclaimer: Certain features of it may not work unless you are using a custom rom so be warned)

If I missed anything important or want additional stuff here please let me know through an issue. I hope this guide contributes positively to the community that cares about Privacy and security on their Android devices and have a great day! :)
